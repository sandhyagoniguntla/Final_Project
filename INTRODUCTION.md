# Project name: Visualize your City
### Introduction:
  Considering the type of neighbourhood people presently living in, they would prefer to move to a 
similar neighbourhood or move to another neighbourhood with better living conditions. 
  
  Comparing two cities is based on different categories like cost of living, connectivity through 
transport, crime rate, employment opportunities, education institutions, Immigration rate, population,
ethnically and culturally diversity, cleanliness, population, Tax rates, weather and climate and local amenities.
       
  In this project, I am comparing the neighbourhoods of New York and Toronto to find out how similar or dissimilar
they are based on crime statistics. This report represents statistical and visual representation of crimes in New York 
and Toronto using matplotlib and Folium API .  Geo spatial Analysis of the crime rate is shown for NewYork and Toronto.
        
  The New York City Police Department (NYPD) provides statistics that are categorized by police borough and precinct. 
Through Foursquare location data the exact location of the precinct station and the neighbourhoods they serve is extracted.
Toronto Polics Service provides crime statistics based ON MCI(Major crime Indicators )by NeighbourhoodPolice Division
